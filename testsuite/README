Test suite for cronolog
=======================

The test suite checks 

* the functionality of the cronolog utility functions
* that log files are created in the correct directories
* that changes to daylight saving time are acted on correctly
* that the year 2000 poses no problems

Unfortunately the testsuite is not yet written ;-)
