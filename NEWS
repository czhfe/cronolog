1.6.1 (20-Dec-1999)

* Cronolog submitted to Apache Software Foundation


1.6 (16-Dec-1999)

* Fixed bug in cronolog whereby if it was started shortly before the end of 
  a period it would not rotate until the end of the next period.
  (Thanks to  Charles Thayer <thayer@mediabridge.com> for identifying the bug 
  and supplying the fix.)


1.5b9 (04-Jun-1998)

* Fixed typo in cronolog.c and cronotest.c  [[ if (start_time); { ... } ]]
  (gcc -Wall doesn't even flag it!)

* changed definition of multi-line string constants to use proper ANSI string 
  concatenation 


1.5b8 (08-Mar-1998)

* Log files only created after a message has been read (you shouldn't
  get empty files)

* time() called only once per message 

* Extra debugging code (see README)

* Updated documentation


Major changes in release 1.5 (11-Apr-1997):

* Fixed problem with change to daylight saving time (summer time).

* Restructured to conform to GNU standards (now uses GNU automake and autoconf).

Major changes in release 1.4 (20-Dec-1996):

* Optimization of create_subdirs: don't bother stat'ing directories
  that form part of a common prefix with the last filename checked.


Major changes in release 1.3 (16-Dec-1996):

* Fixed portability bugs. 


Major changes in release 1.2 (15-Dec-1996):

* Creates missing directories as needed.

* First version announced on comp.infosys.www.servers.unix (renamed to cronolog).

   
Major changes in release 1.1 (09-Dec-1996):

* Fixed problem with log files being created with the wrong dates.

  (When a new log file is due to be created, the time used for filling
  out the template should be the start of the current period and not
  the time at which a new log file is due.  This was observed with daily
  logs where there were no transfers for two days; the next log file
  generated had the date of the first of the days with no transfers.)

* Also added more comments and fixed handling of week numbers where
  weeks start on a Monday.


Major changes in release 1.0 (06-Dec-1996):

* Initial version sent to Apache developers' mailing list 
  (at that time cronolog was called strftimelog)
